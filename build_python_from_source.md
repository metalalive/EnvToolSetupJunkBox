### Python 3.9
Tested on Ubuntu 14.04LTS & Debain 9 (Raspbian Stretch)

* Install dependency packages
```
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential tk-dev libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libreadline6-dev \
             libdb5.3-dev libgdbm-dev libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev libbz2-dev libexpat1-dev \
             liblzma-dev zlib1g-dev libffi-dev tar wget vim
```

* Download Python source code & Go to the downloaded Python source directory

* Configure everythin required (you may need root priviledge to do things). For those who built OpenSSL from source for whatever reasons, you better specify path of your openssl installation path, with `--with-openssl`, `CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` options when running `./configure` below:

```
./configure  --with-openssl=/PATH/TO/YOUR/OPENSSL_INSTALL_FODLER/ \
    --enable-optimizations \
    CFLAGS="-I/PATH/TO/YOUR/OPENSSL_INSTALL_FODLER/include" \
    LDFLAGS="-L/PATH/TO/YOUR/OPENSSL_INSTALL_FODLER/"
```

* Recheck `config.log`. For those who built OpenSSL from source, make sure you get following results :
```
configure:xxxxx: checking for openssl/ssl.h in /PATH/TO/YOUR/OPENSSL_INSTALL_FODLER/
configure:xxxxx: result: yes
configure:xxxxx: checking whether compiling and linking against OpenSSL works
configure:xxxxx: result: yes
configure:xxxxx: checking for X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_host in libssl
configure:xxxxx: result: yes
```

* start building
```
make build_all -j 1 >& build.log
```

* Recheck build.log. For those who built OpenSSL from source, make sure you DON'T have the following message in your `build.log`, otherwise you will get some troubles later when you try to install packages through `pip`.
```
Failed to build these modules:
_ssl
.....
Could not build the ssl module!
Python requires an OpenSSL 1.0.2 or 1.1 compatible libssl with X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_host().
LibreSSL 2.6.4 and earlier do not provide the necessary APIs, https://github.com/libressl-portable/portable/issues/381
....
```

* If Python is built successfully, you should see executable file `python` in the Python source directory. It's optional to run `make install`, instead you can run python directly at the source folder :
```
user@localhost: ~/xxx/$ ./python 
Python 3.9.0a5 (default, Apr  6 2020, 13:28:07) 
[GCC x.x.x] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
```


* Now install or upgrade `pip` for newly built python3.9 (you may need root priviledge to do this)
```
./python -m pip install whatever
./python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

* Recheck `pip` version by running `./python -m pip --version`, you should see result like this (pip version might be different in your case):
```
pip 20.0.2 from /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pip (python 3.9)
```

* Tty install whatever packages you need using `pip` (example below), For those who built openssl from source, recheck the execution result, you should see download progress of the packages.  

```
./python -m pip install pytest
```
