* program the prebuilt firmware using ```esptool``` , the command :
  ```
  sudo python3 ../esptool/v2.6/esptool.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200 write_flash \
                0x0000 ./bin/boot_v1.7.bin \
                0x1000 ./bin/at/512+512/user1.1024.new.2.bin \
                0xfc000 ./bin/esp_init_data_default_v08.bin \
                0x7e000 ./bin/blank.bin \
                0xfe000 ./bin/blank.bin
