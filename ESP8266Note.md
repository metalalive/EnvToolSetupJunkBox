#### Download AT firmware to target ESP8266 board

* prepare USB-to-TTL cable connecting Tx/Rx pins of ESP8266 board (in my case it's ESP-01s) and host PC which runs ```esptool``` later.
* 3.3 Volt. to VDD pin of ESP board. I powered ESP board using 3.3V pin on STM32F4 board , it works well.
* always assert GPIO2 by connecting the pin to VDD (3.3 Volt.)
* left GPIO0 unconnected .
* download pre-built *ESP8266_NONOS_SDK* and *esptool*
* program the prebuilt firmware using ```esptool``` , the command :
  ```
  sudo python3 ../esptool/v2.6/esptool.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200 write_flash \
                0x0000 ./bin/boot_v1.7.bin \
                0x1000 ./bin/at/512+512/user1.1024.new.2.bin \
                0xfc000 ./bin/esp_init_data_default_v08.bin \
                0x7e000 ./bin/blank.bin \
                0xfe000 ./bin/blank.bin 
  ```

when you get result like following, the firmware should be successfully written to target board.
